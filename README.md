# Classification of Backlink Pages
## Background
An effective way to build relevance and authority signals related to the google search engine algorithm is to get links from other sites to your sites and pages.  These links are known as backlinks.  To find sites that could potentially link to your site, you can research a similar pageâ€™s backlinks and determine a strategy for getting your link placed on that page or a similar page.  

There are several different backlink page types that have been identified including:

* Article  
* Guest Articles (sometimes called guest posts)
* Resource pages
* Scholarships and Giveaways
* Sponsorships

The goal of this exercise is to build a classifier to identify these page types when given a set of urls.  Generally these pages are mutually exclusive BUT there are instances where they seem to have elements of both on the same page.
